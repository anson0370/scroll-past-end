With the version 0.132.0, there is an official option `Scroll Past End` in Settings view.

So we can use the official feature and this package won't update anymore.

Thanks for used this package.

~~# Scroll Past End~~

~~Just like Sublime can do!~~

~~Because Atom's autoscroll strategy, this package retain last 3 lines when scroll to end. (Sublime retain only 1 line)~~
